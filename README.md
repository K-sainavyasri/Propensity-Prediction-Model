Worked on Data Pre-processing: Undertook comprehensive data pre-processing tasks to ensure the data was ready for accurate and efficient modeling. This included addressing skewness in the data distribution, managing and analyzing correlation among features, handling imbalanced datasets to improve model fairness, and identifying and mitigating outliers that could skew results. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was implemented to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance by retaining the most significant features.

â€¢ Formulated an Ensemble Model: Developed a robust ensemble model that integrated the strengths of multiple machine learning algorithms. This model combined the probability outputs of XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Random Forest to improve predictive accuracy and generalization. By leveraging the complementary strengths of these algorithms, the ensemble model was able to provide a more reliable and well-rounded prediction, effectively addressing the complexities of the data and improving overall model performance.
